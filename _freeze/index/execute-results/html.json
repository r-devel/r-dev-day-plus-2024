PLUS<br><br></small></center>\n\n## What will happen at the R Dev Day?\n\nTasks will be prepared in the run-up to the event, but are likely to include:\n\n * Reviewing, analysing and fixing bugs reported on R’s [Bugzilla](https://bugs.r-project.org/).\n * Contributing to message translations via [Weblate](https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/).\n\n## Who can take part?\n\nThe sprint will involve a mixture of invited and self-nominated participants, so that we have contributors at all experience levels.\n\nThe main criteria for participation is a good knowledge of R programming and a keen interest in contributing, as we hope participants continue to contribute after the event. The table below shows the type of knowledge/skills we expect participants to have\n\n| Skills most will have |                   Skills some will have                    |\n|:------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|\n|  Writing R functions  |                      Programming in C                      |\n| Debugging R functions |           Knowledge of S3/S4 classes and methods           |\n| Writing R help files  | Expertise in statistical methods in **stats**, **splines** |\n| Using git/Subversion  |                Able to build R from source                 |\n\nOther specialist skills e.g. expertise in building Windows/MacOS GUIs or fluency in a language with a low percentage of translated messages on [Weblate](https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/), would of course be welcome!\n\nIt will help if you have some experience in contributing to base R, but novice contributors will be mentored in the run-up to the event. There will also be a *Contributing to R* tutorial at useR! 2024, which we encourage novice contributors to attend.\n\nWe are keen to foster a diverse community of contributors. If you are a member of the [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/), [MiR](https://mircommunity.com/), [RainbowR](https://rainbowr.netlify.app/), [AfricaR](https://africa-r.org/), [ArabR](https://github.com/ARab-R), [AsiaR](https://bit.ly/join_asiaR_slack), or [LatinR](https://latin-r.com/) communities, or otherwise identify as part of an underrepresented group among R contributors, then we especially encourage you to self-nominate! To ensure a welcoming environment, we have a [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct.html) in place.\n\n## Apply for a place\n\nAnyone one interested to attend the sprint is encouraged to self-nominate via the [application form](https://rfoundation.limequery.com/834329) by **Sunday March 24** (anywhere on earth). You will be asked about your experience, skills and background to help us balance participation overall.\n\nThanks to the R Foundation, participants can attend the R Dev Day free of charge, with refreshments and lunch provided. We regret that support is not available for travel or accommodation, but note that [diversity and need-based scholarships](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/user/attend/scholarships/) are available for useR! 2024, which precedes the R Dev Day (deadline 17 March, 11:59 CET). Scholarship recipients would be expected to participate fully in useR! 2024, otherwise registration at useR! 2024 is **not** required to participate in R Dev Day.\n\nParticipation is in person by default. If you are an established contributor and wish to support the event remotely, please contact the organizing team. \n\n## Practicalities\n\nThe sprint will be held in the [Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences](https://www.plus.ac.at/natural-and-life-sciences/?lang=en) at PLUS, which is ~30 minutes from the useR! 2024 venue by public transport.\n\nSee the [travel information](https://www.plus.ac.at/natural-and-life-sciences/contact-travel-information-directions/?lang=en) on the PLUS website for more detail.\n\n## Organizing team\n\nThis event is being organized by members of [R Contribution Working Group](https://contributor.r-project.org/working-group) in coordination with the R Core Team.\n\n::: people-gallery\n::: {#person}\n\n<img src=\"media/heather_turner.jpg\" alt=\"Headshot of Heather Turner.
