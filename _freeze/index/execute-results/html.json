This will be an opportunity for novice and experienced contributors to work alongside members of the R Core Team on contributions to base R. Interested contributors are encouraged to self-nominate by **Sunday March 24, 2024**.\n\n<center>![The outside of the Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences building: a large, modern building with several glass-house style atriums.](NLW-Sommer-aussen-3-400.jpg)<br> <small>© Universität Salzburg. PLUS<br><br></small></center>\n\n## What will happen at the R Dev Day?\n\nTasks will be prepared in the run-up to the event, but are likely to include:\n\n-   Reviewing, analysing and fixing bugs in code or documentation reported on R’s [Bugzilla](https://bugs.r-project.org/).\n-   Contributing to message translations via [Weblate](https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/).\n\n## Who can take part?\n\nThe sprint will involve a mixture of invited and self-nominated participants, so that we have contributors at all experience levels.\n\nThe main criteria for participation is a good knowledge of R programming and a keen interest in contributing, as we hope participants continue to contribute after the event. The table below shows the type of knowledge/skills we expect participants to have\n\n| Skills most will have |                   Skills some will have                    |\n|:---------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------:|\n|  Writing R functions  |                      Programming in C                      |\n| Debugging R functions |           Knowledge of S3/S4 classes and methods           |\n| Writing R help files  | Expertise in statistical methods in **stats**, **splines** |\n| Using git/Subversion  |                Able to build R from source                 |\n\nOther specialist skills e.g. expertise in building Windows/MacOS GUIs or fluency in a language with a low percentage of translated messages on [Weblate](https://translate.rx.studio/projects/r-project/), would of course be welcome!\n\nIt will help if you have some experience in contributing to base R, but novice contributors will be mentored in the run-up to the event. There will also be a *Contributing to R* tutorial at useR! 2024, which we encourage novice contributors to attend.\n\nWe are keen to foster a diverse community of contributors. If you are a member of the [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/), [MiR](https://mircommunity.com/), [RainbowR](https://rainbowr.netlify.app/), [AfricaR](https://africa-r.org/), [ArabR](https://github.com/ARab-R), [AsiaR](https://bit.ly/join_asiaR_slack), or [LatinR](https://latin-r.com/) communities, or otherwise identify as part of an underrepresented group among R contributors, then we especially encourage you to self-nominate! To ensure a welcoming environment, we have a [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct.html) in place.\n\n## Apply for a place\n\nAnyone one interested to attend the sprint is encouraged to self-nominate via the [application form](https://rfoundation.limequery.com/834329) by **Sunday March 24** (anywhere on earth). You will be asked about your experience, skills and background to help us balance participation overall.\n\nThanks to the R Foundation, participants can attend the R Dev Day free of charge, with refreshments and lunch provided. We regret that support is not available for travel or accommodation, but note that [diversity and need-based scholarships](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/user/attend/scholarships/) are available for useR! 2024, which precedes the R Dev Day (deadline 17 March, 11:59 CET). Scholarship recipients would be expected to participate fully in useR! 2024, otherwise registration at useR! 2024 is **not** required to participate in R Dev Day.\n\nWe encourage people to self-nominate even if their attendance depends on other applications being successful (e.g. for useR! scholarship/presentation or visa).\n\nParticipation is in person by default. If you are an established contributor and wish to support the event remotely, please contact the organizing team.\n\n## Venue\n\nThe sprint will be held in rooms HS 414 and HS 415, which are on the 1st floor of the [Faculty of Natural and Life Sciences](https://www.plus.ac.at/natural-and-life-sciences/?lang=en) at PLUS, which is \\~30 minutes from the useR! 2024 venue by public transport.\n\nSee the [travel information](https://www.plus.ac.at/natural-and-life-sciences/contact-travel-information-directions/?lang=en) on the PLUS website for detail of how to reach the venue.\n\nFor people near Salzburg main station, we recommend to get the trolley bus line 3, which runs every 15 minutes ([Google map of route](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Salzburg,+Salzburg,+Austria/Hellbrunner+Str.+34,+5020+Salzburg,+Austria/@47.7962524,13.0245431,14z/am=t/data=!4m19!4m18!1m5!1m1!1s0x47769078f3c7634f:0xfb02fe56aad5409c!2m2!1d13.0450707!2d47.8130704!1m5!1m1!1s0x477690ee813d0841:0x16fa60c5c6daaf15!2m2!1d13.0602049!2d47.7885515!2m3!6e1!7e2!8j1720775700!3e3!5i1?entry=ttu), [O-Bus 3 timetable](https://fahrplan.oebb.at/webapp/?context=TP&SID=A%3D1%40O%3DSalzburg%20Hbf%40X%3D13045559%40Y%3D47812824%40U%3D81%40L%3D8100002%40B%3D1%40p%3D1720689459%40&ZID=A%3D1%40O%3DSalzburg%20Faistauergasse%40X%3D13064634%40Y%3D47790557%40U%3D81%40L%3D591034%40B%3D1%40p%3D1720689459%40&date=12.07.2024&time=08:15:00&timeSel=1&returnTimeSel=1&journeyProducts=7167&start=1&#!P%7CTP!H%7C653667)).
